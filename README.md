Adding A Folder
===============
Adding a folder of images to your background queue in Curator is as simple as clicking 'Add Source' and navigating to the directory you wish to add, then clickong 'Ok'

Adding A Subreddit
==================
Thanks to the Reddit API allowing the use of multi-subreddit search, instead of having to manually add in each subreddit, when teh user clicks 'Add Subreddit', they can concatenate the list of subreddits that they with to use with '+' in between each name. If a user wanted images from the "wallpapers" subreddit and the "cats" subreddit, they would enter "wallpapers+cats".
