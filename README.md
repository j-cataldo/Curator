Installation
============
Run Setup.exe, follow the steps, and start Desktop Curator!

Uninstallation
==============
The uninstaller can be run through the Windows Control Panel, under "Uninstall a Program", or "Add/Remove Programs" on older versions of Windows.

Key Features
============
-Easy-to-use GUI which allows the user to save and organize images from a variety of sources into their own personal wallpaper library
-Works with any image format: JPEG, BMP, PNG, TIFF
-Switch between wallpapers randomly or in a defined order at whatever interval the user would like
-Pause, rewind, or skip ahead through the slideshow 
-Specify and select images from various subreddits
-Improved multi-monitor support for high-resolution displays
-Select whether to stretch, fit, or tile different images on an individual basis, or let the program decide based on resolution (SmartFit)

Easy-To-Use GUI
===============
This graphical user interface was designed with the user in mind. With minimalist design, and a higher level of granularity given to the user, we have created the iTunes of wallpaper management.

Adding A Folder
===============
Adding a folder of images to your background queue in Curator is as simple as clicking 'Add Source' and navigating to the directory you wish to add, then clickong 'Ok'

Adding A Subreddit
==================
Thanks to the Reddit API allowing the use of multi-subreddit search, instead of having to manually add in each subreddit, when teh user clicks 'Add Subreddit', they can concatenate the list of subreddits that they with to use with '+' in between each name. If a user wanted images from the "wallpapers" subreddit and the "cats" subreddit, they would enter "wallpapers+cats".

Improved Multi-Montior Support
==============================
Curator automatically detects if you are using two or more monitors, and will assign differnt backgrounds to each monitor, staggering when each is changed. So if you have two monitors, and assign a change every 30 seconds, after 30 seconds, the first monitors background will change, and then after another 30 seconds, the second monitor's background will change.

Notes
=====
For Curator's Reddit integration feature to work properly, Python 2.7 must be installed on your C:\ drive (in the directory C:\Python27).
